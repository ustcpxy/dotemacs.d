* personal emacs config
It is highly inspired by [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][doom-emacs]].

I have migrated from [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][spacemacs]] to =doom-eamcs= for two years. but now it is getting swollen too.

so it's time to change.
I'd like to build a personal emacs config from zero.

happy hacking.
